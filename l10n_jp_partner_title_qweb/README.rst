Usage
=====

This module will create title records for '様' and '御中'. When you update a
partner record for Individual/Company selection or Language, an appropriate
title should be proposed.

The module updates the partner name presentation in Qweb reports to show the
title according to its Display Position setting.

Note that installation of this module does not automatically update the title
setting of existing partners.
